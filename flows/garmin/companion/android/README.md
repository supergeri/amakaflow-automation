# Garmin Companion Flows - Android

Placeholder for Android-side Garmin companion Maestro flows.

## Status

Not yet implemented. The iOS companion flows should be ported here once
the Android app has Garmin Connect IQ integration.

## Planned Flows

- `sync-smoke.yaml` - Validates Garmin sync UI on the Android companion app

## Notes

- Maestro can only test the phone-side UI, not the Garmin watch
- Android flows will mirror the iOS companion flows in `../ios/`
- Requires Garmin Connect IQ Android SDK integration in the app
- Expected Android appId: `com.amakaflow.companion`
